# Cricket-Scoreborad-Using-Tkinter
  - This was my first semester project.
  - You will have to run the batting and bowling file, in this file all the other files are imported.
  - The data that you will enter will be saved in a excel sheet.
  - I have made the UI using tkinter.
  - I have also provided the images that i had used.
